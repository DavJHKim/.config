# .config

This repository contains my personal **dotfiles / configuration files** for tools such as Neovim, tmux, Vim, and others. It serves as a centralized place to maintain, version, and share my preferred development environment setup.

## üí° Overview

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `nvim/` | Neovim configuration (plugins, settings, keymaps, etc) |
| `tmux/` | tmux configuration (layouts, status bar, plugin setup) |
| `vim/` | Legacy Vim configurations (if needed) |
| `requirements.txt` | List of dependencies needed (e.g. for language servers or helper scripts) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Highlights

- Modular and version-controlled configuration for each tool  
- Plugin management and automated setup (e.g. install / sync)  
- Custom mappings and workflows tailored to Neovim + tmux integration  
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, possibly Windows / WSL)  
- Backup and safety: symlinks or scripts may back up existing dotfiles before overwriting
